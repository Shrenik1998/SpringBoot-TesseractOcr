Tesseract OCR(Optical Character Recognition)
Tesseract processes images by analyzing shapes and patterns within characters, which it converts to recognizable text through a series of OCR algorithms. When integrated into applications, Tesseract allows for automation of text extraction, making it useful for scenarios like digitizing printed documents, extracting text from scanned forms, or converting images with text into readable content.

Tesseract OCR setup
Step 1: Download Tesseract OCR
Download: Click here to download Tesseract OCR 
Install: Run the installer and follow the on-screen instructions. During installation, note the path where Tesseract is installed (usually something like C:\Program Files\Tesseract-OCR\ on Windows).
Step 2: Set Up Environment Variable
Locate Installation Path: Confirm the installation path of Tesseract. It is typically C:\Program Files\Tesseract-OCR\ on Windows, but adjust based on where you installed it.
Set Environment Variable:
Open System Properties:
On Windows, press Win + X, select System, then Advanced System Settings.
Under the Advanced tab, click Environment Variables.
In System Variables, select Path, and click Edit.
Click New and add the path to the Tesseract installation directory (e.g., C:\Program Files\Tesseract-OCR\).
Click OK to save and close all windows.
Verify Installation: Open a command prompt and type “tesseract -v”


Tesseract OCR with spring boot
In this project, Tesseract OCR is used in a Spring Boot application to allow users to upload images through a web interface. The application processes these images, extracts the text using Tesseract, and returns the extracted text back to the user.

Step 1 : Add Tesseract Data Path in application.properties
In your application.properties file, add the path to Tesseract's data directory:
“tesseract.data.path=C:\\Program Files\\Tesseract-OCR\\tessdata”
Step 2 : Run the Project
Start your Spring Boot application by running.
Step 3 : Open Localhost
Open your browser and go to http://localhost:8080.
Step 4 : Upload an Image
Use the frontend page to upload an image. The extracted text will be displayed on the page once processing is complete.
